- I was sick last week and am struggling with the click events.  I'm sorry it's not fully working.
- I've tried using a seperate js file and within the html document.
- I will continue to work on it even though it's late now.
- (3:30pm)I did finish a basic version, though it's about 30 minutes late.
- (4:45)Last update The finished program is in the updated folder, Again I'm sorry it's late
- I have not commited anything to the main folder past the due date/time except the readme.md
